LOLCODE
=======

FUCK THIS SHIT.

# Writing LOLCODE

Use `vim` fuckers.

# Installation & Compiling

Run `install.sh` in order to install compiler, watch for instructions.

If you want to be awesome and use `vim` with syntax highlighting, run `install_vim_syntax.sh` after or run `install_all.sh` to do both at the same time, cause you know, you're lazy as fuck.

Example: `lol fuckthisshit.lol` should give the string "FUCK THIS SHIT".
Run with `-nobanners` to not show LOLCODE banners.
